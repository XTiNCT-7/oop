# Object-Oriented Programming in Java - A Beginner's Guide

This project is designed to help beginners understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical examples in Java. The project takes a step-by-step approach, starting from basic concepts and gradually building up to more complex implementations.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates OOP concepts through practical examples, making it easier for beginners to understand and implement these concepts in their own projects. Each concept is explained with clear examples and real-world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this OOP learning project, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Java syntax and language fundamentals
- Familiarity with:
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control structures (if/else, loops)
  - Methods and parameters
  - Basic class and object syntax
  - Using IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code for Java development

This project focuses on OOP concepts and patterns rather than basic Java syntax. If you need to brush up on Java basics, consider reviewing the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) first.
