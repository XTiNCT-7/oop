# Project Structure

This document explains the organization of the Java project and how different OOP concepts are implemented.

## Directory Structure

```

├── Program.java                                 # Entry point of the application
├── BasicObjectCreation/
│   ├── BasicObjectCreation.java                 # Basic object execution
│   └── Employee.java                            # Employee entity

    ├── Inheritance.java                         # Inheritance execution

```

## Code Organization

- Each concept has its own folder and Java files.
- The `Employee` class is implemented in each concept as needed.
- Execution files demonstrate usage.

## Progressive Learning

1. Start with [Basic Object Creation](./basic-object-creation.md)
2. Move to [Encapsulation](./encapsulation.md)
3. Learn [Abstraction](./abstraction.md)
4. Master [Polymorphism](./polymorphism.md)
5. Understand [Inheritance](./inheritance.md)

## Running Examples

To run examples:

1. Open `Program.java`
2. Uncomment the example you want to run
3. Run the application using your IDE or `java` command

## Best Practices

- Each concept is self-contained
- Code is commented for learning
- Examples progress from simple to complex

## Next Steps

Ready to start learning? Begin with [Basic Object Creation](./basic-object-creation.md) and follow the learning path through each concept.
