# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance lets one class inherit properties and methods from another class.

## Example

```java
public abstract class Employee {
    // ...existing code...
}

public class PermanentEmployee extends Employee {
    // ...existing code...
}
```

## Why Do We Need Inheritance?

- Code reusability
- Type hierarchies
- Extensibility
- Code organization

## Best Practices

- Use inheritance for "is-a" relationships
- Prefer composition for "has-a" relationships
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies

## Next Steps

Great job making it through all the Object-Oriented Programming concepts! Keep practicing and building real projects!
